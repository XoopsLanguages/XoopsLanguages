    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4><br/>

    This little module has a single purpose: to help you build in your site an editorial column section, where you can manage the columns and articles published in an ordered fashion.<br/><br/>

    It uses Smarty templates, can take comments, it's fully searchable, includes notification options, and lets users rate the articles as well as send private messages to the authors. Also, you can decide which groups of users see what specific columns.<br/><br/>


    <h4 class="odd">Install/uninstall</h4><br/>
