Installing XOOPS

   1. Copy the content of the htdocs/ folder where it can be accessed by your server
   2. Ensure mainfile.php and uploads/ are writable by the web server
   3. For security considerations, you are encouraged to move directories "/xoops_lib" (for XOOPS libraries) and "/xoops_data" (for XOOPS data) out of document root, or even change the folder names.

Installing Protector in XOOPS
-----------------------------------
We also highly recommend the installation of the PROTECTOR module which will bring additional security protection and logging capabilities to your site:
To install protector module with a fresh new installation of XOOPS, delete the mainfile.dist.php available at the xoops root, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /htdocs/mainfile.dist.php and rename it to mainfile.dist.php BEFORE installing XOOPS.
To install protector module with upgrading from a previous version to XOOPS 2.3.1, delete the mainfile.dist.php available at the xoops root, copy /extras/mainfile.dist.php.protector to /upgrade/upd-2.0.18-to-2.3.0/mainfile.dist.php and rename it to mainfile.dist.php BEFORE upgrading XOOPS.

Upgrading a non UTF-8 site:
UTF-8 encoding has been introduced into XOOPS 2.3 as default charset. However, there might be some problems with converting existent websites from non UTF-8 charset to UTF-8.
Before there is a good enough solution for this conversion, following settings are recommended when you upgrade an existent website if you are not an experienced user:
 - Select "Do not change" option in "Database character set and collation" step during upgrade process
 - Modify /languages/yourlanguage/global.php to use existent _CHARSET value if it has been changed to UTF-8 in your new global.php file as [code]define('_CHARSET', 'UTF-8');[/code]


Upgrading XoopsEditor package:
In the XOOPS package, there are five editors included: dhtmltextarea and textarea for plain text, fckeditor, tinymce and koivi for WYSIWYG HTML.
Since there are some directory structure changes in both fckeditor and tinymce editors, you are recommended to remove existent editors before uploading the new additors.
And if you are using fckeditor for modules, please modify module specific configs following the files in /fckeditor/modules/, especially if you use "article" module.


Debug information display level
-----------------------------------

Since XOOPS 2.3.1 debug information display level is enabled as a temporary solution for 2.3* to show debug information to different level of users: to all users, to members or to admins only.
The configuration can be set in /xoops_data/configs/xoopsconfig.php
A new debug information renderer is redesigned in XOOPS 3.0



Files integrity check
-----------------------------------

The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files have been correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions:

   1. Upload the checksum.php and checksum.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php).
   2. Execute checksum.php with your browser
   3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files
   4. Remove checksum.php and checksum.md5 from your server


Modules
-----------------------------------

This release contains only the "system-related modules". You are invited to browse the XOOPS modules repository to if you need additional functionality. Note: as a new repository is being built, the current repository is not up-to-date, PLEASE VISIT INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS' WEBSITES TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING LATEST VERSION OF MODULES.
