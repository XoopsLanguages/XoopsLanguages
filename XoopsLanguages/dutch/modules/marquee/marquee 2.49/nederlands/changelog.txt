v2.0 & 2.2
=================================
- You can use kiovi to create, in the module's admin part, kiovi to create your marquees
- If the module detects that a web spyder is reading its content then it will replace the marquees with pure text
- You can add blocks on-fly as following (so it means that you can create as many marquees as you want, not only 4).
	1 Enter 'Administration Menu'=>"block admin"=>"Add new block"
	2 In the "Add a new block":
	2.1 Block Type: choose anyone as you prefer
	2.2 Weight: input any valid value as you prefer
	2.3 Visible: select any one as you prefer
	2.4 Visible in: set any one as you prefer
	2.5 Title: input any valid text as you prefer
	2.6 Content:

		include_once(XOOPS_ROOT_PATH . '/modules/marquee/blocks/marquee_bloc.php');
		b_marquee_custom(1);

	2.7 Content Type: MUSTBE "PHP Script"
	2.8 Cache lifetime: choose any one as you prefer
	2.9 Preview, Submit: press any one as you prefer, BE SURE press at least one time "submit" before leaving block admin

	Explanation : the number between parenthesis, in b_marquee_custom(1), is the marquee's ID you want to display.
	You can see this ID in the module's admin part (that's the first column in the admin's index)
- You have the choice to use a dhtml marquee or the html marquee's tag
- You can show the last informations from the folowing modules :
	- Xoops comments
	- News (1.2 or greater)
