Gallery can control the quality of the JPEGs that it produces when you resize, rotate or make thumbnails from JPEG images.Higher quality images are larger in size than lower quality images. However, in many cases there's a point at which raising the quality increases the size of the files without noticeably affecting the appearance of the image.

Note that changing this value will only affect images changed in the future.");
