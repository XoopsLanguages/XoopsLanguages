Install the module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules. <br /><br />Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the <a href='http://goo.gl/adT2i'>XOOPS Operations Manual</a>");

define("_AM_TDMCREATE_HELP_OPERATINGINSTRUCTIONS_DESC", "The Polls module is very simple to configure and use. Basically you need to:<br /><br />
i)	Create one or more polls for people to vote on (Polls administration -> Add poll)<br /><br />
ii)	Display the Polls block somewhere on your website (not strictly necessary – people can also access them through the ‘Polls’ link in the main menu – but displaying the polls block in a prominent location will encourage people to vote)<br /><br /> 
iii)	Ensure that relevant user groups have access rights to a) the Polls module and b) the Polls block so that they can see it and vote. Detailed instructions on configuring the access rights for user groups are available in the <a href='http://goo.gl/adT2i'>XOOPS Operations Manual</a><br /><br />
iv)	Most management functions for existing polls are found in Polls administration -> List polls.");
