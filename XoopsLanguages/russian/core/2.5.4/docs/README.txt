XOOPS 2.5.4 Beta

The XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of XOOPS 2.5.4 Beta. 

This release is focused on updating our libraries to the latest versions:

- phpMailer 5.1
- TinyMCE  3.4.6
- jQuery 1.6.4

We have also updated all Core modules (PM, Profile, Protector) to the ModuleAdmin GUI, so all of them have a consistent "look & feel"

And we have fixed few bugs. See the Changelog for more details.
