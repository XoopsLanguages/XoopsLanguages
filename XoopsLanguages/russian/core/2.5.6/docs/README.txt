XOOPS 2.5.5 Final

The XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of XOOPS 2.5.5 Final. Several bugs have been fixed as well as security enhancement based on report from High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.

This 2.5 series builds on the XOOPS 2.4.x series with objectives of usability improvements instead of architecture or API changes.
The system module is updated with a major redesign with jQuery based AJAX, done mainly by ForMusS, kraven_30, Mage with contributions from trabis, voltan, Kris_fr, onokazu etc.
Besides usability, some proof-of-concept experiments have also been proven for module and theme development. Unavoidably there are bugs and incompatibility introduced.
