Upgrading a non UTF-8 site:
UTF-8 encoding has been introduced into XOOPS 2.3 as default charset. However, there might be some problems with converting existing websites from non UTF-8 charset to UTF-8.
Before there is a good enough solution for this conversion, following settings are recommended when you upgrade an existing website (if you are not an experienced user):
 - Select "Do not change" option in "Database character set and collation" step during upgrade process
 - Modify /languages/yourlanguage/global.php to use your previous _CHARSET value if it has been changed to UTF-8 in your new global.php file as [code]define('_CHARSET', 'UTF-8');[/code]


XOOPS Editors Upgrade:
In the XOOPS package, there are four Editors included: dhtmltextarea and textarea for plain text,  CKeditor and TinyMCE for WYSIWYG HTML. 
There are six additional WYSIWYG Editors available: FCKeditor, Koivi, NiceEdit, Wymeditor, Xinha, and Spaw2 that you can download from XOOPS SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xoops/files/XOOPS%20Editors/)
Since there are some directory structure changes in both fckeditor and tinymce editors, you are recommended to remove existent editors before uploading the new additors.
And if you are using FCKeditor for modules, please modify module specific configs following the files in /fckeditor/modules/, especially if you use "Article" module.


Debug information display level
-----------------------------------

Since XOOPS 2.3.1 debug information display level is enabled as a temporary solution for 2.3* to show debug information to different level of users: to all users, to members or to admins only.
The configuration can be set in /xoops_data/configs/xoopsconfig.php
A new debug information tools will be available for 2.4 using FireBug (see http://tinyurl.com/nmnjdp)



Files integrity check
-----------------------------------

The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files have been correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions:

   1. Upload the checksum.php and checksum.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php).
   2. Execute checksum.php with your browser
   3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files
   4. Remove checksum.php and checksum.md5 from your server
