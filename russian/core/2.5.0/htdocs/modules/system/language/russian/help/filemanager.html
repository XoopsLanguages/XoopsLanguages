Using File Manager you have access to all the files within the XOOPS installation. You can do following:<br><br>
- edit content of each file (if there is an editor available - you'll see the Edit icon)<br>
- change Unix file permissions for each file<br>
- delete a file<br>
- create new directory<br>
- create new file<br>
- upload a file<br><br>

Thanks to File Manager in XOOPS, you don't need FTP application for simple file operations/changes.
