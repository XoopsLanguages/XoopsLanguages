XOOPS 2.5.1 Final Release

The XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of XOOPS 2.5.1 Final. Several bugs have been fixed as well as security enhancement based on Aung Khant's report.
Please be aware that the bugfix is not complete and 2.5 series will be following small but frequent release rule so that users can take advantage of quick fixes.

This 2.5 series builds on the XOOPS 2.4.x series with objectives of usability improvements instead of architecture or API changes.
The system module is updated with a major redesign with jQuery based AJAX, done mainly by ForMusS, kraven_30, Mage with contributions from trabis, voltan, Kris_fr, onokazu etc.
Besides usability, some proof-of-concept experiments have also been proven for module and theme development. Unavoidably there are bugs and incompatibility introduced.
Developers are encouraged to improve the new functions and APIs but not advised to use them immediately in their modules since the they are designed with new architecture in XOOPS 3 (or Xoops Engine).
Developers can check Xoops Engine details at http://www.xoopsengine.org to prepare for their next version of modules and themes.
