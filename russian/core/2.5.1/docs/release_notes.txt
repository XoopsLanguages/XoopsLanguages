XOOPS 2.5.1 RC Release

The XOOPS Development Team is pleased to announce the release of XOOPS 2.5.1 RC. Several bugs have been fixed as well as security enhancement based on Aung Khant's report.
Please be aware that the bugfix is not complete and 2.5 series will be following small but frequent release rule so that users can take advantage of quick fixes.

This 2.5 series builds on the XOOPS 2.4.x series with objectives of usability improvements instead of architecture or API changes.
The system module is updated with a major redesign with jQuery based AJAX, done mainly by ForMusS, kraven_30, Mage with contributions from trabis, voltan, Kris_fr, onokazu etc.
Besides usability, some proof-of-concept experiments have also been proven for module and theme development. Unavoidably there are bugs and incompatibility introduced.
Developers are encouraged to improve the new functions and APIs but not advised to use them immediately in their modules since the they are designed with new architecture in XOOPS 3 (or Xoops Engine).
Developers can check Xoops Engine details at http:://dev.xoopsengine.org to prepare for their next version of modules and themes.

   2. Ensure mainfile.php and uploads/ are writable by the web server

   4. Make the directory xoops_data/ writable; Create (if not already present) and make the directories xoops_data/caches/, xoops_data/caches/xoops_cache/, xoops_data/caches/smarty_cache/ and  xoops_data/caches/smarty_compile/ writable.

Installing Protector in XOOPS
-----------------------------------
We also highly recommend the installation of the PROTECTOR module which will bring additional security protection and logging capabilities to your site.


Debug information display level
-----------------------------------

Since XOOPS 2.3.1 debug information display level is enabled as a temporary solution for 2.3* to show debug information to different level of users: to all users, to members or to admins only.
The configuration can be set in /xoops_data/configs/xoopsconfig.php


Files integrity check
-----------------------------------

The full XOOPS package is released with a script able to check if all the system files have been correctly uploaded to the server. To use it, follow these instructions:

   1. Upload the checksum.php and checksum.md5 files located in the XOOPS package root to your XOOPS server folder (putting them next to mainfile.php).
   2. Execute checksum.php with your browser
   3. If necessary, re-upload the missing or corrupted system files
   4. Remove checksum.php and checksum.md5 from your server
